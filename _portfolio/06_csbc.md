Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are characterized by their biological heterogeneity, which enables these cancers to evolve rapidly and evade therapy.
We asked whether an in silico modeling and simulation of TNBCs, informed by deep biological measurements, may establish a robust system to begin evaluating efficacy of drug treatment scheduling.
With a small team composed of graduate students and post-docs from OHSU, Stanford, Berkeley, and UCLA, we were awarded $36600 from the West Coast Cancer Systems Biology Consortium to give it a try.

I'm the team-lead focused on bringing [PhysiCell](http://physicell.mathcancer.org/), an agent-based simulations of cancer growth kinetics, online through OHSU's [high performance computing system](https://www.ohsu.edu/advanced-computing-center/acc-and-exacloud-cluster).

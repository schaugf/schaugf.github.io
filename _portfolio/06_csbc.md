Triple negative breast cancers (TNBCs) are characterized by their characteristic heterogeneity, which enables these cancers to evolve rapidly and evade therapy.
We asked whether an in silico simulation of TNBC, informed by biological measurements, may provide a robust system to begin evaluating efficacy of drug treatment scheduling.
Our small team is composed of graduate students and post-docs from OHSU, Stanford University, Berkeley, and UCLA and was awarded $36600 from the Cancery Systems Biology Consortium to give this a try.
My focus is leading the team focused on informing agent-based simulations of cancer growth kinetics and deploying simulation routines on our [high performance computing](https://www.ohsu.edu/advanced-computing-center/acc-and-exacloud-cluster) system at OHSU.

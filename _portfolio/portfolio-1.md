# Seeing where metastases come from

Deep neural networks are powerful computational tools for learning features in diverse imaging datasets. Working with collaborators in the [Knight BioLibrary](https://knightdxlabs.ohsu.edu/home/research-services/knight-cancer-institute-biolibrary) at the Knight Diagnostic Laboratories, we are training deep learning systems to identify where metastatic cancer comes from just by looking at it. 

You can find a few preliminary results in our [bioRxiv paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/689828v1)

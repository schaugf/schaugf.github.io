# Seeing where metastases come from

Metastatic cancers can often arise from just about anywhere, often finding nefarious homes in the liver, brain, lung, or bone.
Interestingly, metastatic cancers often exhibit morphological features similar to their primary site of origin.
Leveraging this bit of insight, I'm working with collaborators in the [Knight BioLibrary](https://knightdxlabs.ohsu.edu/home/research-services/knight-cancer-institute-biolibrary) at the Knight Diagnostic Laboratories to develop deep learning systems to predict where metastatic cancer comes from just by looking at it.

This work is ongoing, but you can find a few preliminary results in our [bioRxiv paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/689828v1)

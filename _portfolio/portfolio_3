How does the microenvironment surrounding cancer cells affect cancer's growth? The Microenvironment Microarray enables high-throughput combinatoric screening of dozens of extracellular matrix components and signaling ligands in a single experiment.
We turn to unsupervised feature learning methods to identify associations between treatment conditions and cluster the conditions according to similarity in multicellular phenotype.

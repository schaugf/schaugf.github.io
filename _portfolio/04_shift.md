While the research world is busy advancing modern multiplexed technologies, most of pathology still depends on cheap, fast, and simple H&E imaging.
Led by labmate Eric Burlingame, we're exploring not only whether an aritifial intelligence model can learn image-to-image translation between domains, but also whether a market is available for commercialization.
Our team won a $40,000 Biomedical Innovation Program award from [OCTRI](https://www.ohsu.edu/octri), and Erik and I won an additional $5,000 from a commercialization competition, which you can learn about from [InventOR](https://www.inventoregon.org/post/ohsu-team-shifting-perspective-on-disease-detection-with-ai) and the [blog](https://blogs.ohsu.edu/researchnews/2019/09/19/future-of-digital-pathology-leaps-ahead-with-ai-student-project/) over at OHSU.

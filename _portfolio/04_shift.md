While the research world is busy advancing modern multiplexed imaging technologies, most of pathology still depends on cheap, fast, and simple H&E imaging to make diagnoses.
Led by labmate Eric Burlingame, we're exploring whether conditional generative adversarial networks can learn to translate images from H&E into realistic immunofluorescence.  
This approach enables virtual staining that's hundreds of times faster and thousands of times cheaper than generating the real stain, so we've also been exploring a market for commercialization.
Our team won a $40,000 Biomedical Innovation Program award from [OCTRI](https://www.ohsu.edu/octri), and an additional $5,000 Impact Award from the [InventOR commercialization competition](https://www.inventoregon.org/post/ohsu-team-shifting-perspective-on-disease-detection-with-ai).

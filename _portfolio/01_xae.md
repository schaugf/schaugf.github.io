Imaging and genomic sequencing technologies represent two pillars of biomedical science and technologies, each capturing distinct aspects of cellular properties essential for describing underlying biological processes.
When presented with single-cell resolution measurements from both imaging and genomic domains of the same underlying biological sample, a natural problem arises: how do we pair an image of a cell with its corresponding genomic profile?
Though still preliminary, you can get an idea of our learning approach [here](https://github.com/schaugf/XAE)

How does the microenvironment surrounding cancer cells affect cancer's growth? The Microenvironment Microarray enables high-throughput combinatoric screening of dozens of extracellular matrix components and signaling ligands in a single experiment.
Working closely with our collaborators at the OCSSB, we are employing unsupervised learning methods to identify associations between treatment conditions and how they affect multicellular phenotype.

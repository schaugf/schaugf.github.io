- December, 2019: Presented our work at the Learning Meaningful Representations of Life ([LMRL](https://lmrl-bio.github.io/)) workshop at this year's [NeurIPS](https://neurips.cc/) conference following an incredible week of talks, demos, and conversations with folks from all over the AI space. Looking forward to next year!
- November, 2019: Had a great time at the [2019 Oregon Bioengineering Symposium](https://blogs.oregonstate.edu/bioengineering/) at Oregon State University meeting folks from across the state bringing industry and academia leaders in our field closer together
- November, 2019: Honored to have had the opportunity to participate in the 9th annual [Integrated Mathematical Oncology](http://labpages.moffitt.org/imo/) Workshop on Evolutionary Tumor Boards at Moffitt Cancer Center! Fascinating and exhausting week of learning, modeling, coding, and presenting our work on the mathematics of recurrence in glioblastoma multiforme. (With special [shout-out](https://twitter.com/ara_anderson/status/1192819406474272768) from our host, Sandy Anderson!)
- October, 2019: Our project proposal *In silico optimization of drug treatments in triple-negative breast cancer* has been funded ($36,600) by the [West Coast Cancer Systems Biology Consortium](https://csbconsortium.org/news/inaugural-cancer-systems-biology-consortium-west-coast-symposium/)! We've got a great team!
- September, 2019: The whole Chang Lab attended the [BioImaging Informatics Conference](https://alleninstitute.org/events-training/bioimage-informatics-2019/) at the Allen Institute in Seattle full of fascinating and beautiful imaging science
- September, 2019: Got on stage to talk shop at the [Frontier of AI-Assisted Care Scientific Symposium](http://med.stanford.edu/frontierofaicare/abstract.html) at Stanford University, with an [action photo](https://www.flickr.com/photos/184699232@N04/48804546867/in/album-72157711087671666/)
- August, 2019: Gave a talk on the NEMO project at the [PacNow Quantitative Biology Symposium](https://sites.google.com/site/pacnowqb/home) co-hosted with Reed College @ OHSU. 
- August, 2019: Attended the Microscopy & Microanalysis ([M&M](https://www.microscopy.org/MandM/2019/)) Conference right here in Portland! Came for the Nobel laureates, stayed for the flashy imaging tech demos.
- June, 2019: Erik and I brought home a $5,000 Impact Award from [InventOR](https://www.inventoregon.org/post/ohsu-team-shifting-perspective-on-disease-detection-with-ai) for the SHIFT project! See more at the [OHSU blog](https://blogs.ohsu.edu/researchnews/2019/09/19/future-of-digital-pathology-leaps-ahead-with-ai-student-project/) 
- April, 2019: Funded by OCSSB to attend and present our work at [IABCR](https://www.iabcr.net/) in Egmond an Zee, The Netherlands w/ Kristof Torkenscy of the [Adey Lab](https://adeylab.org/). Learned some things, shared some things, even stopped to smell the tulips.
- February, 2019: Presented current work at the [SPIE Medical Imaging Conference](https://www.spie.org/conferences-and-exhibitions/past-conferences-and-exhibitions/medical-imaging-2019?SSO=1) in sunny San Diego

I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Computational Biology Program](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/computational-biology) and [Biomedical Engineering Department](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/biomedical-engineering/about) at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, OR. Under the mentorship of [Young Hwan Chang](https://sites.google.com/site/yhchangucb/home), I work through the [OHSU Center for Spatial Systems Biomedicine](https://www.ohsu.edu/spatial-systems-biomedicine-center) and the [Knight Cancer Institute](https://www.ohsu.edu/knight-cancer-institute) to develop data-driven and deep learning approaches to better understand the role of spatial organization in cancer. 
My work is principally funded through The Center for Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ([M2CH](https://www.ohsu.edu/spatial-systems-biomedicine-center/measuring-modeling-and-controlling-heterogeneity-center-cancer)), a U54 Research Center through the National Cancer Institute and [Cancer Systems Biology Consortium](https://csbconsortium.org/) focusing on advancing understanding and control of triple negative breast cancer.  My research interests broadly pertain to biology at single-cell resolution, computational approaches for multi-modal data integration, and deep learning methods for tumor characterization.

This fall I will begin a new position as Associate Scientist in Digital Pathology & Artificial Intelligence with the Oncology Biomarker Development team at [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/) in South San Francisco. While there, I will be acquiring additional mentorship from Professor [Garry Nolan](https://web.stanford.edu/group/nolan/) at Stanford University in multiplex imaging technology and computational methods development.

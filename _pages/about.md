I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Computational Biology Program](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/computational-biology) and [Biomedical Engineering Department](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/biomedical-engineering/about) at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, OR. Under the mentorship of [Young Hwan Chang](https://sites.google.com/site/yhchangucb/home), I work through the [OHSU Center for Spatial Systems Biomedicine](https://www.ohsu.edu/spatial-systems-biomedicine-center) and the [Knight Cancer Institute](https://www.ohsu.edu/knight-cancer-institute) to develop data-driven and deep learning approaches to better understand the role of spatial organization in cancer. 
My work is principally funded through The Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ([M2CH](https://www.ohsu.edu/spatial-systems-biomedicine-center/measuring-modeling-and-controlling-heterogeneity-center-cancer)), a U54 Research Center through the National Cancer Institute and Cancer Systems Biology Consortium focusing on advancing understanding and control of triple negative breast cancer.  
My research interests broadly pertain to biology at single-cell resolution and the development of computational approaches to integrate diverse data modalities from complementary technologies to enhance our understanding of tumor evolution.

For a bunch of reasons, I try to maintain a relatively low online profile, particularly with respect to social media and the like. I own no twitter, facebook, or linkedin account nor do I have any plans to. As such, this simple website is the majority of my public-facing web-presence. 
If you want to contact me, I recommend you email me directly at schau.geoffrey@gmail.com.

Hi, I'm Geoff.
I am currently an Associate Scientist in Digital Pathology & Artificial Intelligence within the Oncology Biomarker Development team at [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/) in South San Francisco.
My work employs computer vision and in particularly deep learning methods to interrogate the spatial biology of tumor tissue and to identify meaningful features and structures associated with clinical cancer biology and its response to targetted therapy.
Although I focus primarily on tissues stained with hematoxylin and eosin, my research interests broadly pertain to multiplxed imaging technologies, biology at single-cell resolution, and computational approaches for multi-modal data integration.

Prior to joining Genentech, I was a PhD candidate in the [Computational Biology Program](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/computational-biology) and [Biomedical Engineering Department](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/biomedical-engineering/about) at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, OR. Under the mentorship of [Young Hwan Chang](https://sites.google.com/site/yhchangucb/home), I worked through the [OHSU Center for Spatial Systems Biomedicine](https://www.ohsu.edu/spatial-systems-biomedicine-center) and the [Knight Cancer Institute](https://www.ohsu.edu/knight-cancer-institute) to develop data-driven and deep learning approaches to better understand the role of spatial organization in cancer. 
My work was principally funded through The Center for Measuring, Modeling and Controlling Heterogeneity ([M2CH](https://www.ohsu.edu/spatial-systems-biomedicine-center/measuring-modeling-and-controlling-heterogeneity-center-cancer)), a U54 Research Center through the National Cancer Institute and [Cancer Systems Biology Consortium](https://csbconsortium.org/) focusing on advancing understanding and control of triple negative breast cancer.  

Before beginning my PhD, I spent three years as an applied research engineer involved in rapid prototyping and developing biomedical signal processing approaches for implantable medical device technologies. While working full-time, I completed a master's degree in electrical engineering under the direction of [James McNames](http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mcnames/) at [Portland State University](https://www.pdx.edu/).  Before that, I completed a bachelor's degree in biomedical engineering at [Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology](https://rose-hulman.edu/).

I am currently a PhD candidate in the [Computational Biology Program](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/computational-biology) and [Biomedical Engineering Department](https://www.ohsu.edu/school-of-medicine/biomedical-engineering/about) at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, OR. Under the mentorship of [Young Hwan Chang](https://sites.google.com/site/yhchangucb/home), I work through the [OHSU Center for Spatial Systems Biomedicine](https://www.ohsu.edu/spatial-systems-biomedicine-center) and the [Knight Cancer Institute](https://www.ohsu.edu/knight-cancer-institute) to develop data-driven and deep learning approaches to better understand the role of spatial organization in cancer. My research interests broadly pertain to biology at single-cell resolution and the development of computational approaches to integrate diverse data modalities from complementary technologies to enhance our understanding of tumor evolution.

For personal, professional, and philosophical reasons, I try to maintain a relatively low online profile, particularly with respect to social media and the like. I own no twitter, facebook, or linkedin account and have no plans to open any such thing. If you want to contact me, email me directly at schau.geoffrey@gmail.com.
